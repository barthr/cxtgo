# Cxtgo : general interface to popular cryptocurrency exchanges

Cxtgo provides an general interface for popular cryptocurrency exchanges. It's inspired by https://www.ccxt.trade library but with a more idiomatic interface for go. Cxtgo primary focus is based on performance, making it very suitable for high frequency trading algorithms.

The goal is to keep the api as simple as possible and to adapt every exchange to this generic interface and types.
